Learning systems -> machine Learning

__What is machine learning__?
* Learn from experience $E$ with respect to task $T$ and performance measure performance $P$

## Machine learning types

__Supervised__
* Regression
* Classification

__Unsupervised__
* Clustering
* Anomaly detection

__Other__
* Reinforcement learning
* Semi-supervised learning
* Active learning: Algorithm that tells what to learn in order to learn better

# Supervised
Including regression and classification
* Fit model in hyperplane, dimensions greater than 3 dimensions
## Regression
* continuous 
* Real values
* Linear, Quadratic function ($2^{nd}$ order polynomial)

## Classification
* Discrete
* Classes

# Unsupervised
Dont have any targets
* Group data by similarities


TO ASK:
Why is labs mandatory??
